# Analyzing determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy
## Business Problem, Opportunity, and Impact
### Overview of industry, business, or problem
Covid-19 has overturned the world, forcing countries globally to enact lockdown measures to keep high caseloads from overwhelming healthcare systems. The rapid development of the vaccine was seen as a light out of the tunnel and an end to the pandemic. Underlying this vision was the concept of “herd immunity” which requires a large enough part of the population to be vaccinated, rendering transmission of the virus unlikely. The figures for herd immunity vary (from 70-90% [[1]](https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20210414/faq-herd-immunity-and-covid-19) but recent reports from scientists are warning that herd immunity likely won’t ever be achieved due to vaccine hesitancy among certain segments of the population [[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/03/health/covid-herd-immunity-vaccine.html). Our project will be looking at that segment to understand what factors play into vaccine hesitancy and how vaccine rollout policies can be developed with them in mind to ensure healthcare outcomes like herd immunity are actually met.

### Define the specific problem that should be solved
What are the determinants and key factors that play into COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy across the American population?

We plan on approaching this question through a few lenses.
* One is through identity based categories via census and self-reported data:
    * ethnicity/race
    * socioeconomic factors (education level attainment, poverty rate, median income, unemployment)
    * political orientation
    * birth rate
    * religiosity
    * and other datasets as they become available
* Secondly, we plan on looking at the impact of social media on vaccine hesitancy by analyzing public Twitter data for vaccine hesitancy

## Why does this problem matter?
Creating effective healthcare policies requires a deep understanding of patient mindsets, health inequities and the impact of external parties on healthcare messaging. Without a strong understanding of where, why and who these people that are hesitant to vaccines are, herd immunity will be an impossible task to achieve.

## Potential Audience
We imagine that healthcare workers, policy makers and all levels of government would be interested in such an analysis and data to better inform their work. A strong facility of determinants of vaccine hesitancy would give them a better toolkit for combating it along all levels of patient interactions (doctors in vaccine hesitant towns to federal healthcare policy makers allocating vaccine distribution).
