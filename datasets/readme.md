# Data Dictionary
We collated together several different datasets together from various sources in our project. The vast majority were from official government sources, namely census surveys and models. All raw data is available under the `datasets/raw/` folder. We combined and cleaned these into a single file for ease of use, available in the `datasets/clean/` folder.

A listing of all available fields in our dataset is as follows:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Column Name</td>
        <td>Type</td>
        <td>Description</td>
        <td>Source</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`fips`</td>
        <td>Integer</td>
        <td>Description</td>
        <td>[CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/Vaccine-Hesitancy-for-COVID-19-County-and-local-es/q9mh-h2tw)</td>
    </tr>
